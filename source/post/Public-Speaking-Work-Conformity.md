####Conformity

Last week, when I was waiting for the green man at a pedestrian crossing, a phenomenon attracted me. Because there were not so much cars, somebody crossed the street before the light changed green. Somebody else began to cross the street. We broken the rules. One or two individuals broken the rule, before long, everyone did this. Why? because others broken the rule. This psychology is called Conformity.

Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in belief for behavior in order to fit in with a group. This change is in response to real or imagined group pressure. In 1951, Asch , a pioneer in social psychology , conducted an experiment to  investigate the extent to which social pressure from a majority group could affect a person to conform. In the experiment, there were eight participants, but only one was real participant. They were given two cards: one has one line, and the other has three lines. They are asked to compare the length of the one line with the other three to determine which is the same length as the original line. The other participants give their answers, one by one.They unanimously gave an answer that was clearly wrong. The real participant sat at the end of the row and gave his or her answer last. Over the 12 critical trials about 75% of participants conformed at least once, and 25% of participant never conformed. Why did the participants conform so readily? With the interview after the experiment, there are always two main reasons: because they are afraid of being ridiculed or have a desire to be liked and because they believe that the group is better informed than they are.

Is conformity good or bad? In fact, it\`s a absurd question.Conformity can make you feel that you are a part of a group and provides a sense of security by following norms. On the other hand, blinding following indicates is always not the smart option. 	So how to deal with the conformity? The first thing you should know is that conformity is a common psychology and don\`t have any prejudice. With the right understanding, you should try your best to establish your own value system. And learn to think and analyze a problem independently. The other people`s choice can be a reference, but not a final decision.

In a word, conformity is general in our life. We should treat conformity correctly and develop our own judgment and value system. Thanks!
